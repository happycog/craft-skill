    /**
     * Create an entry in Craft.
     *
     * - An "Entry" in Craft is a generic term. Entries could hold categories, media, and a variety of other data types.
     * - You should query the sections to get the types of entries that can be created. Always use the section type and
     * section definition to determine if the user is requesting an "Entry".
     * - When creating a new entry pass an integer `$sectionId` and an integer `$entryTypeId`. You can use other tools
     * to determine the appropriate IDs to use.
     * - Attribute and field data can be passed native attributes like title, slug, postDate, etc. as well as any
     * custom fields that are associated with the entry type. You can look up custom field handles with a separate tool
     * call.
     * - The attribute and field data is a JSON object keyed by the field handle. For example, a body field would be
     * set by passing {"body":"This is the body content"}. And if you pass multiple fields like a title and body field
     * like {"title":"This is the title","body":"This is the body content"}
     * - siteId: Optional site ID for multi-site installations. Defaults to primary site if not provided.
     * Use the GetSites tool to discover valid siteId values.
     *
     * After creating the entry always link the user back to the entry in the Craft control panel so they can review
     * the changes in the context of the Craft UI.
     *
     * @param array<string, mixed> $attributeAndFieldData
     * @return array{_notes: string, entryId: int|null, title: string|null, slug: string|null, postDate: string|null, url: string}

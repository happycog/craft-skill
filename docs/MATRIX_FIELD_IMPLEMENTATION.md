# Matrix Field Support - Implementation Summary

## Overview

Expanded documentation and testing for creating Matrix fields in Craft CMS. Matrix fields provide flexible, repeatable content blocks with nested fields, making them essential for modern content management.

## Changes Made

### 1. Core Functionality Enhancement

**File**: `src/tools/CreateEntryType.php`
- Added `uid` field to the return value of the `create()` method
- The `uid` property is required when configuring Matrix fields to reference entry types as block types
- This is a backwards-compatible change that adds additional information to the response

### 2. Documentation Updates

#### `SKILLS/create_field.md`
Comprehensive expansion with:
- Detailed Matrix field creation documentation
- Step-by-step workflow for creating Matrix fields
- Complete settings reference for Matrix-specific options
- Multiple real-world examples (text fields, URL fields, dropdown fields, assets fields)
- Matrix field settings documentation including:
  - `minEntries` / `maxEntries` limits
  - `viewMode` options (cards, blocks, index)
  - `showCardsInGrid` layout option
  - `createButtonLabel` customization
  - `entryTypes` array configuration using UIDs
- Cross-references to related tools

#### `SKILLS/create_entry_type.md`
Enhanced with:
- Added `uid` field to return value documentation
- New example showing how to create entry types for Matrix block types
- Explanation of how the `uid` is used in Matrix field configuration
- Added "See Also" section linking to related tools

#### `docs/matrix-fields-guide.md` (New)
Comprehensive guide including:
- Complete workflow from start to finish
- cURL examples for all API calls
- Matrix field settings reference
- Common patterns (simple content builder, limited content, complex page builder)
- Testing information
- Important notes about Matrix field behavior

### 3. Test Coverage

#### `tests/CreateFieldTest.php`
Added two new comprehensive tests:
- **Test 1**: Create Matrix field with multiple entry types
  - Creates two entry types (Text Block, Image Block)
  - Creates Matrix field with both block types
  - Verifies field configuration (minEntries, maxEntries, viewMode)
  - Validates entry types are correctly attached
  
- **Test 2**: Create Matrix field with advanced settings
  - Tests advanced configuration options
  - Verifies showCardsInGrid, createButtonLabel settings
  - Confirms field instructions and searchable properties

#### `tests/MatrixFieldIntegrationTest.php` (New)
Complete end-to-end integration test demonstrating:
1. Creating entry types for block types
2. Creating custom fields for the blocks
3. Adding fields to block layouts using AddFieldToFieldLayout
4. Creating Matrix field with configured block types
5. Verifying complete field structure including nested fields
6. Proper cleanup of all created resources

### 4. Test Results

All tests pass successfully:
- **261 total tests** pass (1277 assertions)
- Specifically for Matrix fields:
  - 2 new Matrix field creation tests
  - 1 comprehensive integration test
  - All existing field creation tests continue to pass

## Key Features Documented

### Matrix Field Settings
- **minEntries** / **maxEntries**: Control block quantity
- **viewMode**: "cards" (default), "blocks", or "index" 
- **showCardsInGrid**: Multi-column card layout
- **includeTableView**: Table view option in element indexes
- **createButtonLabel**: Custom button text
- **entryTypes**: Array of entry type UIDs

### Workflow Requirements
1. Create entry types first (these become block types)
2. Save the `uid` from each entry type response
3. Optionally create and add custom fields to block layouts
4. Create Matrix field referencing entry types by their UIDs

### Important Behaviors
- Entry types used as Matrix block types can be reused across multiple Matrix fields
- Each block type maintains its own field layout independently
- Matrix fields support unlimited nesting depth
- Block types appear in the order listed in the `entryTypes` array
- UIDs are stable across environments (good for deployment/migrations)

## Backward Compatibility

All changes are fully backward compatible:
- Adding `uid` to CreateEntryType response is additive only
- Existing tests continue to pass without modification
- No breaking changes to any APIs
- Documentation enhancements don't affect existing functionality

## Files Modified

1. `src/tools/CreateEntryType.php` - Added uid to return value
2. `SKILLS/create_field.md` - Comprehensive Matrix documentation
3. `SKILLS/create_entry_type.md` - Added uid documentation and Matrix examples
4. `tests/CreateFieldTest.php` - Added 2 Matrix field tests

## Files Created

1. `docs/matrix-fields-guide.md` - Complete Matrix field guide
2. `tests/MatrixFieldIntegrationTest.php` - Integration test with 28 assertions

## Impact

This update provides complete documentation and testing for one of Craft CMS's most powerful field types. Users can now:
- Understand the complete workflow for creating Matrix fields
- See real-world examples with actual API calls
- Reference comprehensive settings documentation
- Run tests to verify Matrix field functionality
- Follow best practices for Matrix field configuration

## Next Steps

Potential future enhancements:
- Document nested Matrix fields (Matrix within Matrix)
- Add examples for more complex block layouts
- Create helper tools for common Matrix field patterns
- Add validation for Matrix field configuration

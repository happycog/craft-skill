# apply_draft

Apply draft changes to the canonical entry, making content live.

## Route

`POST /api/drafts/<id>/apply`

## Description

Applies a draft to its canonical entry, making the draft content live. This tool applies all changes from the draft to the canonical entry and removes the draft. The canonical entry will be updated with all content from the draft. This action cannot be undone.

After applying the draft, always link the user back to the entry in the Craft control panel so they can review the changes in the context of the Craft UI.

## Parameters
